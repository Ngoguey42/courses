# Week1: Welcome to Calculus One
> Welcome to Calculus! Join me on this journey through one of the great triumphs of human thought.

# Week2: Functions and Limits
> Functions are the main star of our journey. Calculus isn't numbers: it's relationships between things, and how one thing changing affects something else.

### Lesson1: Introduction

### Lesson2: Functions? What's a Function?
- Domain of a function
- Piecewise notation for a function

### Lesson3: Functions in the Real World
- Domain of square root function

### Lesson4: Limits? What's a Limit?
- Limit of a sum
- Limit of sin(1/x)
- Squeeze theorem
- Limit definition

### Lesson5: Working with Limits
- Limit of a product
- Limit of a quotient

### Lesson6: Limits in Motion
- Demo: `speed of a ball`

# Week3: The End of Limits
> People have thought about infinity for thousands of years; limits provide one way to make such ponderings precise. Continuity makes precise the idea that small changes in the input don't affect the output much.

### Lesson1: Introduction

### Lesson1: Continuity
- One-sided limit
- Continuity
- Continuity on intervals
- Intermediate Value Theorem
- Demo: `Computation of sqrt(2)`
- Bisection method

### Lesson2: Infinity? How can I work with that?
- Fixed point theorem
- Demo: `Point in map of Ohio`
- Limits approaching infinity
- Demo: `Why isn't infinity a number`

### Lesson3: Slope?
- Potential vs Actual infinity
- Demo: `Cat and infinite fishes`

### Lesson4: Bonus Videos
- Def: `limit`

# Week4: The Beginning of Derivatives
> It is time to change topics, or rather, to study change itself! When we wiggle the input, the output value changes, and that ratio of output change to input change is the derivative.

### Lesson1: Introduction

### Lesson2: What are derivatives?
- Differentiable function
- Demo: `tangent and derivative`
- Why isn't |x| differentiable

### Lesson3: Why would I care to find the derivative?
- Ex: `Approximate nearby results with deriavative`

### Lesson4: How do differentiability and continuity relate?
- Why is |x| continuous

### Lesson5: How do I find the derivative?
- Power rule for derivatives
- Sum of derivatives

# Week5: Techniques of Differentiation
> With the product rule and the quotient rule, we can differentiate products and quotients. And since the derivative is a function, we can differentiate the derivative to get the second derivative.

### Lesson1: Introduction

### Lesson2: How do I differentiate a product?
- Product rule

### Lesson3: How do I differentiate a quotient?
- Quotient rule
- Rational function

### Lesson4: Higher Derivatives?
- Concavity, inflection point

### Lesson5: How do I sketch a graph without a computer?
- Local/global minimum/maximum/extremum
- Fermat's theorem
- Critical point of a function
- Demo: `Draw a graph sketch by hand`
- Ex: `for a function f, 2x2 table of f slope shape, given f' sign and f'' sign`

### Lesson6: How do I differentiate e^x?
- Ex: `functions with f = f'`
- Function being it's own derivative
- Euler's number

# Week6: Chain Rule
> The chain rule lets us differentiate the composition of two functions. The chain rule can be used to compute the derivative of inverse functions, too.

### Lesson1: Intro

### Lesson2: What is the Chain Rule?
- Ex: `Chain rule pictorialy`
- Derivative of `(1+2x)^5`
- Derivative of `sqrt(x^2 + 0.0001)`

### Lesson3: How do I find the tangent line to a curve?
- Implicit differentiation
- Function vs Relation
- https://www.geogebra.org/o/b8pSTJJF
- foliom of Descartes
- https://www.geogebra.org/o/qrHdwK63

### Lesson4: How do I find the derivative of an inverse function?
- Inverse function
- Derivate of log function
- Logarithmic differentiation

### Lesson5: How can I multiply quickly?
- Quarter squares
- Slide rule

### Lesson6: How do I justify the derivative rules?
- Proof: `power rule`
- Proof: `product rule`
- Proof: `quotient rule`
- Proof: `chain rule`

# Week7: Derivatives of Transcendental (Trigonometric) Functions
> So far, we can differentiate polynomials, exponential functions, and logarithms. Let's learn how to differentiate trigonometric functions.

### Lesson1: Introduction

### Lesson2: What is trigonometry?
- Def: `Transcendental function`
- Unusual trigonometric functions
- Pythagorian identity `sin² + cos² = 1`

### Lesson3: How can I differentiate trig functions?
- Derivative of sin/cos
- Multiple derivatives of sin/cos
- Derivate of tan

### Lesson4: How can I differentiate inverse trig functions?
- Domain restriction of inverse trig functions
- Derivative of asin
- Derivative of acos with asin
- Derivative of atan

### Lesson5: What can we learn from the derivatives of trig functions?
- Reason for sine oscillations
- Calculation of sine value with recursive function

### Lesson6: Multiplying Trigonometric Functions with Slide Rules
- Numbers multiplication with trigo functions

# Week8: Derivatives in the Real World
> Derivatives can be used to calculate limits via l'Hôpital's rule. Given a real-world equation involving two changing quantities, differentiating yields "related rates."

### Lesson1: Intro

### Lesson2: How can derivatives help with limits?
- L'Hôpital rule
- Circular reasoning with l'Hôpital rule

### Lesson3: How can derivatives help me to understand rates of change in the real world?
### Lesson4: How do derivatives help me understand how two rates of change are related?
