# Week1
> Welcome to the course! My name is Jim Fowler, and I am very glad that you are here. In this first module, we introduce the first topic of study: sequences. Briefly, a sequence is an unending list of numbers; since a sequence "goes on forever," it isn't enough to just list a few terms: instead, we usually give a rule or a recursive formula. There are many interesting questions to ask about sequences. One question is whether our list of numbers is getting close to anything in particular; this is the idea behind the limit of a sequence.

### Lesson1: What is a Sequence?
- Term of a sequence
- A sequence can be seen both umerically and geometrically
- Sequences equality

### Lesson2: What are Some Examples of Sequences?
- Ex: Tribonacci ratios
- Arithmetic progression

### Lesson3: What is the Limit of a Sequence?
- Geometric progression
- Geometric mean

### Lesson4: Why Do We Care?
### Lesson5: What Other Properties Might a Sequence Have?
### Lesson6: How Big Can Sequences Be?
